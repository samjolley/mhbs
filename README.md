WordPress Website for Mother Heart Birth Services, a Doula company based out of Grand Blanc Michigan. 
Run by Caty Jolley (my wife), a certified Doula (which is basically a birth coach to help pregnant / laboring women have an awesome experience)

This website uses WordPress (https://wordpress.org/), the Genesis Framework (http://www.studiopress.com/features), and the Utility Pro Theme (https://store.carriedils.com/utility-pro-features/) for their Open Source goodness, all the great features their known for, and accessibility.
